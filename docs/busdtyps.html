<p>In a brokerage application I worked on a few years ago, I believe we
made
a good start at defining a set of useful business classes. Not
surprisingly, the first type of unit we addressed was <i>money</i>,
which is not only the main preoccupation of much of business
programming, but the fuel that makes much of it go.&nbsp; Money,
as defined in our application, has a magnitude and a currency.
Since currencies are so important to our society, we do actually have
3-letter ISO codes for the different currencies - our package supported
about 200 of them. In our package, a monetary value was always
represented
by the ISO code followed (with no intervening blanks) by an amount,
whether for input or for output. Thus we might have CAD205.10, or
USD3012.55.
Each currency has a preferred number of decimals for amounts (although
this does not apply to rates), except for some oddball "currencies"
(such
as Euro-Gold) that allow any number of decimals.&nbsp; In our
application we loaded the currency information at start of session from
a database.</p>
<p>Note that rates have different precision requirements from monetary
amounts. &nbsp;The general rule for currency is that, at the end of a
computation, they must be rounded to whatever the smallest denomination
is in that currency, whereas rates can have any number of decimal
places. &nbsp;In the case of (US and Canadian) currency, the smallest
unit is really the cent, but instead of 12345 cents we usually write
$123.45. &nbsp;This can be handled in most cases&nbsp; by forcing
rounding when the currency amount is turned into displayable format,
e.g. by using some method built on the Java&nbsp;<tt>toString()</tt>
method.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, in our application we provided
a&nbsp;<tt>round()</tt> method which did the same thing to non-display
currency amounts. &nbsp;It has been suggested that we should really
distinguish
between "non-final" and "final" currency values, but that would involve
a vast increase in the number of methods over what we already have, so
I think the above technique is adequate. &nbsp; </p>
<p>In turn, the numeric value in our Monetary class was implemented
using the new Java BigDecimal class which is now available, as of Java
1.5,
replacing the previous one.&nbsp; Even though they have explicit
precision, floating point numbers are not appropriate for monetary
amounts,
although they work quite well for rates (another difference between
rates and monetary amounts) or physical units such as distances.
We chose the new BigDecimal, as its arithmetic has been consciously
designed to give the same results that you would get yourself when
doing
decimal arithmetic by hand.&nbsp; &nbsp;For instance, 3.82 + 2.18
becomes
6.00, not 6.<br>
</p>
<p>Before getting into the specific classes and methods, I would like
to point out that money was really rather an easy class to
define.&nbsp; There is a much more complex issue revolving around the
question of Quantity.&nbsp; We have tentatively added a&nbsp;
class called Quantity to the project, but the real question is
"Quantity of <span style="font-style: italic;">what</span>?".&nbsp;&nbsp;
Quantity
does not extend BigDecimal, as there are many
things you can do with BigDecimal that you do not want to automatically
be able to do with
Quantity - i.e. you cannot normally multiply two Quantities together
(unless it is two lengths to form an area),
and conversely, a Quantity should almost always be a quantity of
<span style="font-style: italic;">something</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Users
can extend Quantity for their own purposes - this will usually entail
adding the <span style="font-style: italic;">thing</span> that it is a
quantity of - what Denis Garneau (the very talented IBM architect who did most of the design work) 
calls its "quality".&nbsp; &nbsp; You
should not be able to add weight to length -
or number of eggs to number of chickens!&nbsp; Denis recently ran into
a mysterious programming bug, which eventually turned out to be caused
by someone adding a temperature to a weight!&nbsp; Alternatively,
Quantity could be an interface, rather than a class. &nbsp; So you see,
we are
starting to stray into the area talked about in <a
 href="http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/physunits.shtml">Physical Units</a>.&nbsp;
Denis
and I would like people to explore this area, especially in
different problem domains, and write papers about it!&nbsp;
Specifically, a) should Quantity be a class or an interface? b) what
extensions/implementations did you need to add to it for your
particular domain of interest?<br>
</p>
<p>As of Nov. 4, 2009, the source code
for these classes can be found
in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jbdtypes/">SourceForge</a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A non-executable jar
file can be downloaded from SourceForge - click <a

<h4>Monetary class</h4>
<p>To give you a flavour, the constructors for our money class, called "Monetary", are as
follows: <br>
&nbsp;
<table align="center" border="2" cellpadding="2" width="95%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th valign="CENTER">Constructors</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><font class="method">Monetary</font>(BigDecimal,
Currency)&nbsp; <br>
Monetary constructor with value initialized from BigDecimal&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><font class="method">Monetary</font> (String)&nbsp; <br>
Monetary constructor using currency + value in String, eg CAD25.74&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>BigDecimal objects are (immutable) decimal numbers with explicit
precision, while Currency objects represent the actual currencies
themselves - thus one Currency object is <i>US dollars</i>, another is
<i>Canadian dollars, </i>while yet another might be <i>
pounds sterling</i> .&nbsp;&nbsp; The first constructor is needed to
build Monetary objects that are the result of a computation; the second
to build them from the String representation. &nbsp;So we needed the
converse operation, which was a method called either <tt>toString()</tt>
or&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>serialize()</tt>.</p>
<p>The complete set of methods we provided for our Monetary class are
as follows: <br>

</p>
<p>This list is to give you a flavour for the kinds of things we felt
would be needed in this class. &nbsp;As requirements for new methods
came up in our application we added them, so if you don't see something
in this list that you would expect, it's probably because the need
didn't come up in our application. &nbsp;You will see that a number of
other classes (apart from the standard Java ones) are mentioned in the
list given above and we will be describing them in what follows -
although perhaps not to such a fine level of detail. </p>
<p>Monetary amounts cannot be multiplied together, but they can be
added,
subtracted, compared against each other, and so on.&nbsp; In all these
cases,
the currency must be the same; if the two currencies involved are not
identical,
an error condition is raised.&nbsp; In our implementation, this was a
run-time
test, as opposed to a compile-time test. In our view it wouldn't make
sense
to make every one of our 200 currencies a different class.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monetary amounts can however be multiplied or divided by instances
of the classes PCPrice and BigDecimal (more about PCPrice later).&nbsp;
These latter are both essentially dimensionless, and in general we can
multiply or divide dimensioned values by dimensionless ones, giving a
result that has the same dimension as the dimensioned quantity.</p>
<p> Note that we allowed a Monetary object to have an undefined
currency. &nbsp;In this state you cannot do anything with it except set
the currency. &nbsp;I am not sure if this function was ever used.</p>
<!--
<h4>Quantity class </h4>
<p>If you look at the above methods, you will notice that dividing a
Monetary by a Quantity is different from dividing it by a BigDecimal -
this implies that quantities are different from simple decimal
values.&nbsp; Think of Quantity as representing a quantity of some
object, e.g. stocks or bonds (or eggs), so dividing Monetary by a
Quantity gives a price (MPrice in our application) - so Quantity has an
implied unit, whereas BigDecimal can be used conveniently to represent
dimensionless quantities</p>
<p>This is where things get a bit complicated! In our application,
Quantity and MPrice did not have units, but we now think we should have
gone
that way. &nbsp;Let us propose that a Quantity must always be a
quantity <i>of</i> something. Then dividing a Monetary by (say)
a Quantity of stocks gives a <i>Monetary price (MPrice) per stock</i>
. The advantage of this would be that we could verify at compile-time
that (say) we are multiplying a price per stock by the number of
stocks,
and not by a number of mutual fund shares. &nbsp;We could have usefully
had
classes such as QuantityOfStock and MPriceOfStock, QuantityOfBonds and
MPriceOfBonds, QuantityOfMutualFunds and MPriceOfMutualFunds. &nbsp; We
believe that we would not actually get a huge number of different
classes, and they would inherit most of the methods from their parent
classes Quantity and MPrice respectively. &nbsp;However, you would
get excellent compile-time checking. &nbsp;Plus, the pricing of these
different classes of financial instruments has some interesting quirks
which could be captured in the class-specific methods. </p>
-->
<h4>Monetary Price (MPrice) class and Percent Price (PCPrice) </h4>
<p>This web page will be talking about the classes we
actually
used in our application, and what their capabilities were. Although
we used BigDecimal for MPrice (in conjunction with Currency), we
allowed an MPrice object to have more decimal places than monetary
amounts. &nbsp;I believe one of the types of floating point number
might
also work well for MPrice, but we went with BigDecimal.. </p>
<p>For now, we are going to expand on the Monetary Price (MPrice)
class.&nbsp; This could be entered as a decimal value, but also as a
fraction of the form "3 + 5 / 16" (usually referred to as a "vulgar
fraction"), where the last integer was always a power of 2.&nbsp;
Supposedly, US stock exchanges are switching to decimal prices soon (or
may already have done so), but at the time we built this system, they
had not yet made the switchover. </p>
<p>We held the three integer fields, provided in a constructor, in
the MPrice object, as well as the decimal value, which was computed if
the price was entered in vulgar fraction form.&nbsp; If the price was
entered as a decimal, the denominator item of the integer fields was
set to zero, and the other two integer fields were ignored. I managed
to figure out a way to calculate the vulgar fraction from the decimal,
and we provided a constructor to do this. Again I'm not sure if it was
ever used. </p>
<p>Here are the constructors for Monetary Prices: </p>

<p>Here are some typical methods for this class:<br>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MPrice<br>
      </td>
      <td><font class="method"> setPriceCurrency</font> (Currency) <br>

      <td><font class="method"> toString</font> () <br>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>
Our brokerage application also required a different kind of price,
which we called "PCPrice".&nbsp; This stands for PerCentPrice and is
basically a dimensionless quantity that is entered or displayed as a
percentage, i.e. 20PCT represents the value .2.&nbsp; PCPrice
also supports "discount" and "premium", coded as DSC and PRM.&nbsp;
20DSC represents a value of .8, while 20PRM represents 1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although PCPrice has interesting ways of being displayed, it is
dimensionless, so it is equivalent to a pure value. Because of this, it
can extend BigDecimal, and its methods are basically whatever it
inherits from BigDecimal, plus a few quirks due to the PCT/DSC/PRM
convention, so
I will not go into it further. &nbsp;
<h4>Exchange Rate (ExchRate) class </h4>
<p>Since we are dealing with multiple currencies, we need a way of
exchanging money.&nbsp; You can't add money of different currencies, so
of course we need an ExchRate class - instances of this class
can be applied to a Monetary value to convert it to Monetary of another
currency. </p>
<p>Its constructors are as follows: </p>
<table align="center" border="2" cellpadding="2" width="95%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th valign="CENTER">Constructors</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><font class="method"> ExchRate</font>(BigDecimal, Currency,
Currency, TimeStamp) <br>
Exchange Rate constructor with value initialized from BigDecimal </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><font class="method"> ExchRate</font> (String) <br>
Exchange Rate constructor using single String, containing value, source
currency, target currency, optional timestamp,
separated by semicolons. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><font class="method"> ExchRate</font>(String, String, String,
String) <br>
Exchange Rate constructor with value initialized from 4 Strings
(TimeStamp will use serialized form) </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>By the way, our TimeStamp class extends the Java Date class, which goes
down to the millisecond, in spite of its name. The Java SQL
TimeStamp class goes down to the nanosecond, but we didn't consider
that
necessary for our application, although we had methods to convert our
time stamps from and to SQL time stamps. We held all time stamps in
UTC format (Universal Time Code) as our application not only dealt in
many currencies, but in many countries and time zones. More about that
later.<br>

<p>You may perhaps have noticed that we didn't integrate the TimeStamp
values into our Exchange Rate methods - this was put in because clearly
exchange rates only apply at a particular point in time.
Ideally, the <tt>convert()</tt> methods should have been tagged
with a TimeStamp, and therefore most other methods dealing with
the ExchRate class. &nbsp;Now most computer applications apply at
some moment in time - they could be called "synchronic", whereas in
real life things change across time ("diachronic"). So it was
reasonable
to leave the time stamp off the exchange rate. &nbsp;We left it in,
however, as a pointer to a wider scope that we could implement at some
time in the future. &nbsp;In fact, in my experience, the time dimension
is always the hardest aspect of&nbsp; computer applications to
implement.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This also illustrates a problem with the "big bang" approach to
system development: if you don't have time to "do it right the first
time" (you never do), you must build in enough flexibility so that you
can move there incrementally, preferably without destroying your
working system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Date, TimeStamp and Time Zone (TimeTz) classes </h4>
<p>This seems like a good time to talk about dates, timestamps and
time zones. &nbsp;Our application had to deal with time zones right
around
the world, as we had to support someone in Tokyo buying a stock that
was
listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the other side of the planet.
&nbsp;
Perhaps in hindsight we should have given our classes different names,
as
Java has some of these classes, both in the Java.util and Java.sql
packages,
but in practice this didn't cause confusion as we hid the Java.util
classes
behind our own. &nbsp; We couldn't hide the Java.sql classes, but the
spelling
difference (see below) helped!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We did have to do a lot of thinking about what times and dates
really <i>mean</i>, as this is something that the designers of most
business applications never have to think about. &nbsp; We decided to
hold times in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), which is based on
Greenwich, UK,
and does not change with Daylight Savings Time (DST). &nbsp;So we had
to know which time zones particular stock exchanges were in, and which
time zones our users would be in. &nbsp;When you are dealing with a
7/24,
world-wide application, the <i>only</i> notation that tells you
whether
two events are simultaneous is UTC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A time zone not only determines how many hours ahead of or behind
UTC the location is, but also when they switch from and to DST - if in
fact they do (Japan does not switch nor does the province of
Saskatchewan in Canada). &nbsp;It turned out that the version of Java
we were using had a very incomplete set of time zones, but an <i>excellent</i>
mechanism
for building new ones! &nbsp; A major part of the problem, as Java has
found out, is that there is no generally agreed on standard for time
zone
names. &nbsp;Java (from 1.2 on) seems to use a convention of
"area/city",
but one of the areas is America, so there are zones with names like
America/Winnipeg, which is not really acceptable in a Canadian
application! &nbsp;Not to
mention America/Manaus, America/Tortola and America/St_Kitts, but for
some
reason Atlantic/Bermuda! &nbsp; And Java certainly does not seem to
know
much about Newfoundland, which is famous (at least up here) for being
1/2
hour out of step with the next time zone (honest!) - it is actually 3.5
hours behind UTC (not counting DST) - Java has it as 4 hours behind,
but
it does say Canada/Newfoundland (I think because it treats it as a
zone,
rather than a city). &nbsp;We therefore used the commonly used Canadian
abbreviations where possible, but these are only really unique within
Canada
&nbsp;and I do not know whether they are encoded in any standards
document.
&nbsp;The problem of coming up with unique, worldwide zone designations
needs to be addressed, but I don't really feel that the Java approach
is
adequate. &nbsp;However, we should give them credit for trying!
&nbsp;In
case you were wondering, it is not enough to just use the offset in
hours
from UTC, as different&nbsp; time zones may have the same offset but
different
rules for beginning and ending DST. &nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>The Java Date class includes time, but ours did not, which I feel is
more logical. &nbsp;Our TimeStamp class was more similar to the Java
Date class, except that the Java Date class has a default time zone,
which we felt would be confusing. &nbsp;It's better to always have to
state the time zone explicitly... <i>when it matters</i>....
&nbsp;Since all timestamps were held in UTC, we only needed time zones
when handling input from, or
output to, humans. &nbsp; Our time zone class is actually a simple one:
we
just used the Java SimpleTimeZone class to build a list of time zones,
identified by a 3-character abbreviation, "CST", "SST", etc., and then
used the abbreviation as an optional part of a time stamp (default was
UTC), e.g. 20021021T13:10:40678!CST. &nbsp; Note that this can only be
converted into a UTC time stamp if the date portion is present.</p>
<p>It actually took a little effort for old-guard programmers to start
thinking in terms of time zones. &nbsp;For example, the date does
depend on the time zone: it can be Tuesday in Tokyo while it's Monday
in Toronto, so you can convert from date plus time (UTC) to the local
date, if you
have the time zone, but you can't go from a date by itself&nbsp; to UTC
unless you know the time <i>and</i> time zone. &nbsp;Actually there is
an hour during the year, in time zones with DST, when the same local
time
repeats itself.</p>
<p>To make things even more interesting, the Java.sql package has Date
and Timestamp (note the lower case 's'):&nbsp; the SQL Date is very
similar to ours, while Timestamp goes down to nanoseconds, which we
really didn't need. &nbsp;We provided conversion methods between our
classes and the corresponding Java.sql ones, so that we could store our
data in relational databases.</p>
<h4>Bool class</h4>
<p>Just to get this class out of the way, I will give a brief
description of this class. &nbsp;We decided we needed a Bool class
mostly because we built a rules-driven decision tool which specified
its rules in XML. &nbsp;A patent is pending on this work: "Rules-Based
Engine for Validating Financial Transactions".&nbsp; I hope you can
read legalese, as I can't, and I helped to write the thing! &nbsp;</p>
<p> A couple of interesting attributes of this class are: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>its serialized form is "1" or "0" - this is because "1" and "0"
are more suitable for multi-language support than "true" and "false"</li>
  <li>in its constructor we treated the null string as a true value. </li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;<tt>equals()</tt> method returns true if and only if the
argument is not null and is a Boolean object that contains the same
boolean value as this object. &nbsp; For obvious reasons, we defined
two public static
final objects called&nbsp;<tt>TRUE</tt> and&nbsp;<tt>FALSE</tt>. </p>
<h4>AccountId, Market, InstrumentId, and Symbol classes</h4>
<p>We are now getting into an area which is less standardized (or
standardizable). The lack of standardization in the industry means that
we cannot specify
classes that will be usable world-wide. &nbsp;However, hopefully the
following
remarks will give some of the flavour of what we felt was needed for
our
particular application..<br>
<br>
In our case, the account ID object was comprised of three parts: <br>
<br>
- identifier (required)<br>
- optional firm<br>
- optional system ID <br>
<br>
It was basically used as an identifier.<br>
<br>
A Market object was identified by its Reuters code, and had attributes
such as time zone, open and close times, list of holidays, country code
and quote currency. &nbsp; The open and close times were reloaded at
the
start of every day, as occasionally a particular market would be closed
unexpectedly,
for varying amounts of time, e.g. an hour or a half-day. &nbsp;In
addition
the open and close times could be different for different financial
instruments,
so this information had to be stored, and reflected in the methods we
provided.<br>
<br>
InstrumentId was constructed out of a schema (a number) and a financial
instrument ID. The schema numbers indicate what coding scheme is used
for the financial instrument ID. The schema numbers are as follows:<br>

<p>A Symbol object identified something that is traded in a market.
&nbsp;It was constructed out of a market ID, symbol, and country code.
&nbsp;This
reflects the fact that a symbol is only unique within a market.
&nbsp;Either
market or country will usually be present - if both are missing, we
used
the default country. &nbsp;<br>
