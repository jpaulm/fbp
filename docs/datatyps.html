<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>In business data processing there is a profound mismatch between the
data types used in the real world and the data types supported by most
programming languages. This is thought to be one of the legacies of the
mathematical origin of computers, but until the advent of high-level
languages with support for user-defined datatypes (such as Java),
nothing much could be done to resolve this
conflict.&nbsp; Most numbers in the real world have units attached to
them - for instance, distances are in feet, metres or parsecs, bank
balances and prices have to be in some currency, dates and times have
to be relative to a given time zone, and so on, but most computer
languages treat all quantities as if they were dimensionless. Many of
the values we handle in our business applications do not have explicit
precisions, so this has to be defined in the code that references
them.&nbsp; Similarly, currency amounts cannot be multiplied, distance
times distance equals area, and dates cannot be added: numbers in the
real world seldom behave the same way that numbers do in a computer. </p>
<p>The vast majority of the numeric values in today's business
applications
are described by working code, not explicitly in (or associated
with) the data itself. It was reported a few years ago that many of
the magnetic data tapes in the tape library belonging to the US Navy
had become illegible, not because of I/O errors, but because the data
formats
were not specified explicitly but only held inside program code, and
nobody knew which programs or copy members described which tapes. </p>
<p>Recently one of the Mars landers was lost because of a mismatch in
units, and there is the famous case in Canada of the so-called "Gimli
Glider".&nbsp; On July 23, 1983, a Boeing 767 operating as Air Canada
Flight 143 <i>glided</i> into Gimli, Manitoba. Here is a quote from a
fascinating description of the so-called "Gimli Glider" incident by
Gail Marsella (*): </p>
<blockquote><font color="#000099">When the ground crew conducted the
drip procedure they determined that the tanks contained 7,682 L.
The crew knew that the flight required 22,300 kg, and they knew
that volume should be multiplied by density to obtain weight. But
the density of jet fuel can be expressed in various units such as
pounds
per gallon, pounds per liter, or kilograms per liter. The ground crew
used the value 1.77 without being certain of its units.</font> <br>
  <font color="#000099">.......</font> <br>
  <font color="#000099">The result was that they added about 5,000 L
when they should have added about 20,000 L.
At the time of takeoff Flight 143 had about 10,000 kg of fuel -
less than half the amount needed to reach Edmonton.
  <br><br>Why did the pilots and ground crew so
readily
accept the value 1.77? Because, when accompanied by the proper units,
it
is a valid conversion factor that they had all used in the past. The
density
of jet fuel is 1.77 pounds per liter.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a quote from a NASA release about the loss
of the Mars Lander:
<blockquote><font color="#000099">The peer review preliminary findings
indicate that one team used English units (e.g., inches, feet and
pounds)
while the other used metric units for a key spacecraft operation. This
information was critical to the maneuvers required to place the
spacecraft in the proper Mars orbit.</font></blockquote>
<p>When humans talk about numeric values, we normally include the units -
thus we would say that a weight is "150 pounds", not just "150". On the
other hand, when transmitting values between computers, we very seldom
include the units, partly because in most cases there are no generally
accepted codes for units, and including codes for units, if they
existed, would imply some (automatic) mechanism for doing conversions
between them, and I am not aware of any such mechanism in common use in
the DP community. However, at a more fundamental level,
a block of data in a computer program is usually programmed as a set of
fields, where each field represents an attribute of the entity being
described, and each field is usually a simple numeric value or
character string. Only floating point numbers include some metadata,
and they are not appropriate for most business uses. This generally
applies even to advanced database concepts such as relational
databases. It was not until the advent of advanced OO languages, such
as Java, that we could start thinking of almost all data as <i>references</i>,
rather than atomic data fields. If an attribute is in fact usually a
reference, then the reference can (and in many cases, should) be to a
complex object, containing both unit and data.
<p>Even when you consider the values themselves, leaving aside the
question of units, there may be a wide variety of different
representations. This is especially vexatious in the context of dates.
Consider a value of 020511: does this represent the 2nd of May 2011? Or
perhaps the 11th of May 2002? Or the 5th of February, 1911?&nbsp; In
the last century, one could be reasonably certain that 94 was the year,
but what about the other two pairs of digits?&nbsp; On the banking
project I worked on, we decided to always display dates as "ddmmmyy"
(later changed to "ddmmmyyyy"), where "dd" is day number, "mmm" is an
alpha month abbreviation, and "yy" or "yyyy" is the year.&nbsp; But
alpha month abbreviations raise the question of natural languages - how
many do you support, and how are they identified?&nbsp; Again, I don't
believe there is any universal standard. </p>
<!--<p>Now, the task of creating classes to represent the whole world of
magnitudes
and units would obviously be a daunting one, but we can take a
manageable
application and develop the classes for that application.&nbsp; The
hope
is that, if this is done carefully, we can use it as a starting-point
to
grow a bigger and bigger set of classes and their related
methods.&nbsp; Just as is currently happening with XML, different
application areas have to develop standards so code and data can be
shared
by everyone who subscribes to these standards.&nbsp; For instance,
to the best of&nbsp; my knowledge, these is no universally accepted, <i>machine-processable,</i>
standard for units of mass, which means that people developing classes
for mass will have to develop their own standards and get them accepted
across a large group of
users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>-->
<p>I believe it is possible to design a set of data classes that are
fairly natural to use in Java, and take advantage of Java's
compile-time checking. However,
in no programming language that I know of can you <i>prevent</i>
programmers from expressing currency amounts as simple scalars - this is after all how we were trained as programmers.  However, in the area of business, I believe you <i>can</i>
provide a set of classes that will be so much easier to use than the
"vanilla" data types that you don't have to stand over the programmers
with a big stick! </p>
<p>In <a href="busdtyps.shtml"> "Business Data Types"</a>, I describe
a set of Java classes that we developed for an electronic brokerage
package that some colleagues and I worked on from 2000 to 2001. These
Business Data Types were posted to SourceForge in 2009 under the
project name <small><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">JBDTypes </span></small>(<a
 href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jbdtypes/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/jbdtypes/</a>),<small><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"></span></small>
and have recently been picked up by Softpedia.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<!-- <p>In <a href="physunits.shtml"> "Physical Units"</a>, you will find a
more speculative discussion of a possible implementation of some of the
ideas discussed above. The classes described in that web page have
never been used for an application, but I feel they make a start
towards addressing a number of the problems I have described. Feedback
would be appreciated.

<p>Since the above was written Werner Keil and his team have made great strides on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/units-dev">Units of Measurement</a>, as well as the Java Specification Request (JSR) (<a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=363">JSR 363</a>) - Units of Measurement API.  I am sure Werner would be happy to add interested readers to his distribution list.</p>
